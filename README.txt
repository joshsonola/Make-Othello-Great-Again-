Contributions from each team member:

The majority of the coding for Heuristic was done by Mojo, while Vinci
helped to debug and make minor changes to the code.
For MiniMax, we worked together to reason through how we could 
implement the algorithm that was provided. We coded and debugged
MiniMax together. 


Modifications for tournament player:

We only implemented Heuristic and MiniMax :(
